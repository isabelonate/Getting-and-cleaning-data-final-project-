# Getting-and-cleaning-data-final-project-
Isabel OÃ±ate Falomir

This repository is for the final project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

# The project
The objective of this excercise is to demonstrate the hability to collect assemble and clean a data set, producing a tidy dat set that can be used for further analysis.
The instructions were to create an R script that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# The script
In order to run the "run.analysis.R" script it is necesary to change the working directory to where the unziped files are saved.
Addition information about the variables can be found in the CodeBook.md file.
